<h1 align="center">Ocean: The Data Economy</h1>

> ðŸ’§ Ocean Protocol
> [oceanprotocol.com](https://oceanprotocol.com)


Ocean Protocol is an ecosystem for the data economy and associated services. It provides a tokenized service layer that exposes data, storage, compute and algorithms for consumption with a set of deterministic proofs on availability and integrity that serve as verifiable service agreements. There is staking on services to signal quality, reputation and ward against Sybil Attacks.

Ocean helps to unlock data, particularly for AI. It is designed for scale and uses blockchain technology that allows data to be shared and sold in a safe, secure and transparent manner.


## Mission Statement

Society is becoming increasingly reliant on data, especially with the advent of AI. However, a small handful of organizations with both massive data assets and AI capabilities attained worrying levels of control which is a danger to a free and open society.

Ocean Protocol aims to unlock data, for more equitable outcomes for users of data, using a thoughtful application of both technology and governance.

## Whitepapers

Learn how Ocean Protocol works:

- [Technical Whitepaper](https://oceanprotocol.com/tech-whitepaper.pdf) - This paper presents Ocean Protocol. Ocean is a decentralized protocol and network of artificial intelligence (AI) data/services. It incentivizes for a vast supply of relevant AI data/services.
- [Business Whitepaper](https://oceanprotocol.com/business-whitepaper.pdf) - This document presents a summary of the business model and ecosystem of Ocean Protocol. In addition, it describes the logic behind the Ocean utility token and the economic incentives driving the Protocol. It is complementary to the technical whitepaper for Ocean Protocol.
- [Marketplace Framework](https://oceanprotocol.com/marketplace-framework.pdf) - This document presents a summary of the core marketplace attributes and components required to facilitate the successful deployment of the decentralized data exchange protocol and network called Ocean Protocol.

## Projects

Ocean Protocol implementation is composed by the following projects:

- [Frontend - Pleuston](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pleuston) - Provides the user interfaces enabling the users to publish, consume and discover Ocean Assets. Application implemented using HTML + Javascript + CSS, running in the client side (user's browser).
- [Keeper Contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts) - Solidity Smart Contracts running on the decentralized Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
- [Provider](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider-backend) - Backend application giving some network advanced services. Initially:
  * On-Chain access control
  * Metadata storage
  * Gathering of service proofs
- [Datascience](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/plankton-datascience) - Tools allowing to a Data Scientist to interact with Ocean
